## What is this?

Claude Coordinator is a set of Claude Code agent definitions that turn Claude into a **structured project manager**. Instead of having a single Claude session try to do everything, this system uses three specialized agents that work together:

- **Coordinator** — The control plane. Plans work, maintains state, delegates to workers, requests reviews, and writes context for the next session. Read-only by design.
- **Worker** — The implementer. Receives a strict task contract and executes it. Returns structured results. Follows TDD.
- **Reviewer** — The quality gate. Read-only code reviewer that finds bugs, regressions, missing tests, and security hazards before code is accepted.

The coordinator maintains state across sessions using two mechanisms: machine-readable files in `.coord/` and human-readable files in `docs/`. This means a project can be picked up exactly where it left off, even after days away.

---

## How it works

The coordinator operates as an explicit **7-phase state machine**:

```
intake → plan → delegate → integrate → review → promote-learnings → close
```

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **intake** | Understand the request. Read context files. Clarify ambiguity before proceeding. |
| **plan** | Break work into delegatable tasks. Define task contracts. Identify dependencies. Write plan to `docs/plans/active-plan.md`. |
| **delegate** | Launch worker subagents with strict task contracts. Enforce no file overlap between concurrent workers. |
| **integrate** | Collect worker results. Validate output contracts were fulfilled. Record artifacts in `.coord/tasks/`. |
| **review** | Spawn reviewer subagents for risky changes. Block progress on `critical` or `high` severity findings. |
| **promote-learnings** | Extract insights from completed work. Stage in `.coord/learning-inbox.jsonl`. Promote at milestone boundaries. |
| **close** | Update milestone state. Write compressed context for next session. Summarize results for user. |

The coordinator can revisit earlier phases when new information invalidates the current plan.

---

## Architecture: Three State Layers

Truth is maintained in three places, each with a different purpose:

### 1. `.coord/` — Machine Operational State

Working memory. Ephemeral, structured, machine-readable.

```
.coord/
├── task-ledger.json          # All tasks: pending, in-flight, blocked, done, failed
├── learning-inbox.jsonl      # Candidate learnings (JSON lines) awaiting promotion
├── context-packet.md         # Compressed session context for continuity
├── tasks/
│   └── TASK-XXX.json         # Per-task artifacts: output, files changed, test results
├── reviews/
│   └── REVIEW-XXX.json       # Per-review artifacts: findings, severity, recommendations
└── milestones/
    └── M-XXX.json            # Milestone summaries: scope, tasks, learnings promoted
```

### 2. `docs/` — Durable Human-Readable Memory

Persists across sessions. Authoritative record of intent, practices, and plans.

```
docs/
├── context/
│   ├── current-intent.md     # What we're building and why
│   ├── repo-practices.md     # Conventions, patterns, and rules
│   └── known-issues.md       # Known problems, workarounds, tech debt
└── plans/
    ├── active-plan.md        # Current execution plan with task breakdown
    └── execution-brief.md    # Scoped brief for the current milestone
```

### 3. GitHub Issues — Durable Public Tracker

Used for work that is real and reviewable, may span sessions, needs collaborator visibility, or represents a tracked decision. Not used for internal coordination bookkeeping.

---

## Installation

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennisonbertram/claude-coordinator
cd claude-coordinator
./install.sh
```

This copies the three agent files to `~/.claude/agents/`, making them available globally in all your Claude Code sessions.

### With project initialization

```bash
./install.sh --init-project
```

This also creates `docs/` and `.coord/` directories in your current project with starter template files.

### Manual install

Copy the agent files wherever you need them:

```bash
# Global (available in all projects):
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Per-project (scoped to one project):
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

### Per-project install

If you prefer agents scoped to a single project, copy the files into `.claude/agents/` at your project root instead of `~/.claude/agents/`.

---

## Usage

### Starting a session

```bash
claude --agent coordinator
```

Or open Claude Code and select **coordinator** from the agent picker.

### What happens next

1. The coordinator reads `.coord/context-packet.md` (if it exists) and the `docs/` files to orient itself
2. It asks what you want to work on
3. It enters the `intake` phase, clarifies any ambiguity, then transitions to `plan`
4. Workers are spawned with strict task contracts — each in its own isolated worktree
5. Results are integrated, reviewed if needed, and summarized for you
6. At session end, context is written to `.coord/context-packet.md` for next time

---

## Task Contracts

Every task the coordinator delegates includes a complete contract. Workers may not proceed without one.

```json
{
  "title": "Add rate limiting to the auth endpoint",
  "type": "feature",
  "scope": "Add per-IP rate limiting (100 req/min) to POST /api/auth/login using the existing middleware pattern in apps/server/src/middleware/",
  "allowed_files": [
    "apps/server/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts",
    "apps/server/src/routes/auth.ts",
    "apps/server/src/routes/auth.test.ts"
  ],
  "forbidden_files": [
    "apps/server/src/middleware/auth.ts"
  ],
  "dependencies": [],
  "test_requirements": "Write a regression test that confirms requests beyond the rate limit receive 429. Run the full server test suite.",
  "output_contract": "Return structured output per the worker output format below."
}
```

### Task type values

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feature` | New capability |
| `bugfix` | Fixing a defect |
| `refactor` | Restructuring without behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or improving test coverage |
| `investigation` | Research, analysis, or exploration |
| `review` | Code review (reviewer agent only) |

---

## Worker Output Format

Every worker must return exactly this structure. The coordinator rejects freeform prose.

```
## Task Result

### Scope Completed
- Added rate-limit middleware with configurable window and max-requests
- Wired middleware into POST /api/auth/login route
- Added regression test for 429 response after limit exceeded

### Files Changed
/absolute/path/apps/server/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts
/absolute/path/apps/server/src/routes/auth.ts
/absolute/path/apps/server/src/routes/auth.test.ts

### Tests Run
apps/server/src/routes/auth.test.ts — 12 passed, 0 failed

### New Invariants or Assumptions
- Rate limit state is in-memory; restarting the server resets all counters
- The 100 req/min limit is hardcoded; make configurable if requirements change

### Risks or Blockers
- No distributed rate limiting — multiple server instances will not share state

### Recommended Next Step
- If horizontal scaling is needed, replace in-memory store with Redis
```

---

## Review System

The coordinator spawns a reviewer subagent when any of these conditions apply:

- Changes touch security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, permissions, input validation)
- Changes involve concurrency or shared state
- Changes are user-visible (UI, API responses, error messages)
- Changes touch event surfaces, message formats, or API contracts
- Test coverage appears insufficient
- The task was flagged high-risk

### Severity levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `critical` | Exploitable vulnerability or data loss | Block. Fix before proceeding. |
| `high` | Likely bug or serious regression | Block. Fix before proceeding. |
| `medium` | Possible issue or missing coverage | Coordinator decides whether to fix now or track |
| `low` | Minor concern or improvement | Note for learning promotion |
| `info` | Observation with no action required | May be promoted as learning |

Reviewers return `Approved: YES`, `Approved: NO`, or `Approved: CONDITIONAL` (with explicit conditions listed).

---

## Session Continuity

At the end of every session, the coordinator writes `.coord/context-packet.md` — a compressed summary of:

- Current milestone and progress percentage
- Key decisions made this session
- Open blockers or pending tasks
- State the next session needs to resume correctly

At the start of the next session, the coordinator reads this file first, before anything else. This gives it enough context to resume without re-reading everything from scratch.

You can inspect `.coord/context-packet.md` at any time to see where things stand.

---

## Learning System

The coordinator captures knowledge in a two-stage pipeline:

### Stage 1: Inbox (during tasks)

After each task completes, the coordinator extracts learnings from the worker's output and appends them to `.coord/learning-inbox.jsonl`:

```json
{"task_id": "TASK-007", "learning": "Bun's sqlite driver closes the connection on process exit — explicit close() is not needed in tests", "category": "practice", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:32:00Z"}
{"task_id": "TASK-007", "learning": "Rate limit state is lost on server restart — document this as a known issue", "category": "issue", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:32:01Z"}
```

### Stage 2: Promotion (at milestone boundaries)

When a milestone completes, the coordinator:

1. Reviews all inbox entries
2. Deduplicates and filters noise
3. Promotes accepted learnings to the right durable file:
   - Conventions and patterns → `docs/context/repo-practices.md`
   - Known problems → `docs/context/known-issues.md`
4. Clears promoted entries from the inbox

This keeps the docs accurate and up-to-date without requiring manual maintenance.

---

## Customization

### Change model assignments

Edit the frontmatter in `agents/*.md`:

```yaml
---
model: sonnet   # Change to haiku, sonnet, or opus
---
```

The defaults are `opus` for coordinator and reviewer, `sonnet` for worker. Using `sonnet` for the coordinator saves cost if your sessions are long.

### Add custom phases

The state machine is defined in the coordinator's system prompt. You can add phases by editing `agents/coordinator.md` — for example, adding a `deploy` phase after `close` or a `qa` phase between `integrate` and `review`.

### Adjust review triggers

The review trigger rules are listed in the coordinator's "Review Delegation" section. Edit `agents/coordinator.md` to add or remove trigger conditions.

### Add tools to workers

Workers currently have access to: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep, Agent. To restrict workers (e.g., no Bash), edit the `tools:` line in `agents/worker.md`.

## FAQ

**Can I use Sonnet for the coordinator instead of Opus?**

Yes. Edit the `model: opus` line in `agents/coordinator.md` to `model: sonnet`. Sonnet is faster and cheaper. Use Opus when you need more careful reasoning on complex planning problems.

**Can I skip the review phase?**

The coordinator only spawns reviewers when trigger conditions are met. For low-risk tasks (docs, simple config changes, minor refactors), no reviewer will be spawned automatically. You can also tell the coordinator "skip review for this task" in the intake phase.

**How do I reset state and start fresh?**

Delete or archive `.coord/` and start a new session. The coordinator will detect the missing directory and initialize it fresh. Your `docs/` files (intent, practices, known issues) persist and will still be read at startup.

**Can multiple people use this on the same project?**

Yes, but `.coord/` is designed for a single active coordinator at a time. If two people run the coordinator concurrently on the same branch, the task ledger can get out of sync. Use separate branches if you need parallel sessions.

**What if a worker returns freeform prose instead of structured output?**

The coordinator is instructed to reject non-conforming output and re-delegate with explicit format instructions. If it happens repeatedly, check that the worker agent file was installed correctly.

**Can I use this with Claude.ai (not Claude Code)?**

The agent files are designed for Claude Code's agent system. They won't work directly in the claude.ai chat interface, but you can copy the system prompt content into a Project instruction or Custom System Prompt as a starting point.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please:

1. Open an issue describing what you want to change before submitting a PR
2. Keep agent file changes backward-compatible where possible (existing `.coord/` state should still be readable)
3. Test your changes by running a real session against a test project
4. Update the README if you change any behavior, output formats, or file structures
